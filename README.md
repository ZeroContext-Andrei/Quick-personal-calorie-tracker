A simple multi-day calorie tracking application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

*   Log positive (food) and negative (exercise) calorie items.
*   Persists data across browser sessions using `localStorage`.
*   Edit or delete logged items.

## Running the Application

There are two main ways to run this application:

**1. Simple File Opening (Recommended for basic use)**

*   Navigate to the project directory in your file explorer.
*   Double-click the `index.html` file.
*   This will open the application directly in your default web browser.

**2. Using the Python Development Server**

*   Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
*   Open your terminal or command prompt.
*   Navigate (`cd`) to the project directory (where `server.py` is located).
*   Run the server using the command: `python server.py` (or `python3 server.py` on some systems).
*   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
*   To stop the server, go back to the terminal and press `Ctrl+C`.

## Author's Note (From the User)

Just a heads-up, I (the user asking the AI for help!) put this together primarily as a personal tool to track my calories and motivate myself to work out. I know the code might be a bit rough around the edges or "badly built" in places â€“ it's more about getting something functional for motivation than perfect code!
